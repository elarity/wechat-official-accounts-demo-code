### Moving from types to typeless APIs in Elasticsearch 7.0

Elasticsearch 7.0 deprecated APIs that accept types, introduced new typeless
APIs, and removed support for the _default_ mapping. Read [this](https://www.elastic.co/blog/moving-from-types-to-typeless-apis-in-elasticsearch-7-0)
blog post for more information.

### Type hint and return type

Added type hints and return type declarations in all the code base, where possible.
See PR [#897](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/pull/897).

### PHP 7.1+ Requirement

We require using PHP 7.1+ for elasticsearch-php. PHP 7.0 is not supported since
1st Jan 2019. See [PHP supported version](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) for
more information.
